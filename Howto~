Supported tags and respective Dockerfile links

    latest (Dockerfile)

Usage

Note This image is required to run with privileged mode.
Using the embedded Apache web server

# docker run --privileged=true -d --name="spacewalk" -p 80:80 -p 443:443 bashell/spacewalk

Note The self-signed SSL certificate will be generated at the first time you run this container.
Run without exposing port 80 and 443

# docker run --privileged=true -d --name="spacewalk" bashell/spacewalk

Then inspect the running container to get an IP address.

# docker inspect -f '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' spacewalk
172.17.0.126

Now you can use an NginX reverse proxy (with you real SSL certificate) to 172.17.0.126 port 80 and 443.
Build and run your own image

# clone https://bitbucket.org/bashell-com/spacewalk /opt/docker-spacewalk
# docker build --rm -t spacewalk /opt/docker-spacewalk
# docker run --privileged=true -d --name="spacewalk" spacewalk

Customizing

    Self-signed SSL certificate will be generated from /opt/answer.txt, which you can override using -v option.
    docker run --privileged=true -d --name="spacewalk" -v /path-to-your/answer.txt:/opt/answer.txt bashell/spacewalk
    Volumes below will be created, which you may want to manage them separately from the container life cycle.
    /var/log System log
    /var/lib/pgsql/data PostgreSQL data
    /var/satellite RPM repository
    /var/www/html/pub Bootstrap directory
